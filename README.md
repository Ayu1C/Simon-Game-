This is a game which tests a player's memory . It has 4 colour buttons. 

At each level a color button gets popped with a sound , the player has to then click on all the buttons starting from level 1 to current level of game. 
If he does it correctly, he is taken to next level, otherwise the game ends if he clicks on any wrong button.
